  abstract  = {What role did fluctuations play in biomass availability for secondary consumers in the disappearance of Neanderthals and the survival of modern humans? To answer this, we quantify the effects of stadial and interstadial conditions on ecosystem productivity and human spatiotemporal distribution patterns during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition (50,000–30,000 calibrated years before the present) in Iberia. First, we used summed probability distribution, optimal linear estimation and Bayesian age modelling to reconstruct an updated timescale for the transition. Next, we executed a generalized dynamic vegetation model to estimate the net primary productivity. Finally, we developed a macroecological model validated with present-day observations to calculate herbivore abundance. The results indicate that, in the Eurosiberian region, the disappearance of Neanderthal groups was contemporaneous with a significant decrease in the available biomass for secondary consumers, and the arrival of the first Homo sapiens populations coincided with an increase in herbivore carrying capacity. During stadials, the Mediterranean region had the most stable conditions and the highest biomass of medium and medium–large herbivores. These outcomes support an ecological cause for the hiatus between the Mousterian and Aurignacian technocomplexes in Northern Iberia and the longer persistence of Neanderthals in southern latitudes.},

  abstract  = {During the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in the Balkan, Italian and Iberian peninsulas of southern Europe, late Neanderthal and early Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) populations may have overlapped in some capacity. Many of the hypotheses and models for the transition interval suggest that Neanderthal populations remained in, or migrated to, refugial zones while AMHs colonized areas not suitable for, or abandoned by, Neanderthals. However, many hypotheses and models have not been conclusively tested due to general issues impeding a clear understanding of the relevant archeological record and because of a lack of specificity in defining and applying the term ‘refugium’. This paper briefly summarizes what is known about the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in southern European Peninsulas and discusses some new directions in the use of refugium concepts in the study of Neanderthal extinction and AMH dispersal. We highlight the complexity of the archeological record in each region and in the studies of refugia more generally. Finally, we make an appeal for generating local, multi-proxy paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic records to address these complexities so that hypotheses and models integrating refugial concepts in explanations of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition can be properly formulated and tested.},

  abstract = {An accurate representation of the spatial distribution of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in modern precipitation is required for many hydrological, paleoclimate, and ecological applications. No standardized method for achieving such a representation exists, and potential errors associated with previously employed methods are not understood. Using resampling, we test the accuracy of interpolated dD and d18O estimates made using four methods. Prediction error for all methods is strongly related to number of data and will likely decline with the addition of new data. The best method lowers estimation error by 10–15% relative to others tested and gives an average error, using all available data, ?2.5% of the global range.We present and interpret global maps of interpolated dD, d18O, and deuterium excess in precipitation and the 95% confidence intervals for these values created using the optimal method. These depict global and regional patterns, make evident the robustness of interpolated isotopic patterns, and highlight target areas for future precipitation sampling.},

In this paper, new evidence of reindeer in the east Cantabrian region is presented that further supports the timing of this species' first appearance, and previous assessments are updated. To date, the presence of this species has been identified at 55 sites in the Iberian Peninsula, nearly as many as those of mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) and woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) combined. Most of the sites with presence of reindeer (50) are located in the Cantabrian region with a clear increase in the density of sites and remains towards the Pyrenees. The remaining five sites with evidence of reindeer are located on the other side of the Pyrenees in the NW corner of Catalonia. In contrast, archaeological evidence of reindeer in the form of art (both parietal and portable) is more scarce and scattered. Evidence for the representation of these animals has been found outside the northern fringe of the Iberian Peninsula, which could reflect either long-distance cultural communication or the movement of human groups. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Boreas Collegium.},

  abstract = {The Cantabrian region of Northern Spain was an important area of human occupation during the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic as the rich archaeological record demonstrates. The environmental conditions experienced by late Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) in the region during MIS3 are still poorly known, but are crucial to understand the role climatic instability could have had on the adaptations of these populations. In this study, a series of archaeological levels with Mousterian and Aurignacian artefact assemblages, dating between 49 and 35 ka uncal. BP, from the sites of El Castillo and Covalejos caves in Cantabria were studied using multi-isotope techniques including bone collagen $\delta$13C, $\delta$15N and $\delta$34S analysis and a pilot study based on tooth enamel $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C. Results at Covalejos indicate a large range in $\delta$15N values observable within both Mousterian Level D and Aurignacian Level B, suggesting the presence of different micro-environments within the local area at certain times during each temporal period. Within Aurignacian Level C and Mousterian Level J, the $\delta$15N values range is much smaller, but shows consistency in the parts of the landscape being exploited during both times. Neanderthals and AMH appear to have been procuring animals from isotopically similar zones (isozones) when they occupied Covalejos. The variations in $\delta$34S values between levels analysed at Covalejos also implies the use of a variety of hunting locations by both late Neanderthals and AMH. At El Castillo, $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values show great consistency between levels, indicating that animals were being hunted from the same isozones when the site was presumably occupied by the two human species. The mosaic landscapes of Cantabria may have buffered the sharp environmental fluctuations that occurred during late MIS3 throughout Europe, providing suitable habitats for the key prey ungulate species that were routinely exploited throughout the Middle and Early Upper Palaeolithic. This environmental buffering may explain why this southerly, oceanic region was consistently occupied throughout this time of bio-cultural transition.},

  abstract  = {The carbonate and phosphate oxygen isotopic difference ($\Delta$18OC-P) has been suggested as a test for diagenetic alteration of isotope values in fossil apatite samples. The generally accepted $\Delta$18OC-P value for well-preserved enamel is $\sim$ 9‰. Only a few studies have focussed on the potential natural variability of this difference in modern and fossil mammal teeth. The aim of this study is to document the value of the carbonate-phosphate oxygen isotopic fractionation factor ($\alpha$CO3-PO4) at an intra-tooth level. We measured the enamel phosphate and carbonate oxygen isotopic compositions of two upper molars (M1 and M2) of Rhinoceros unicornis following a sequence from the apex to the cervix of the crown. The average $\alpha$CO3-PO4 is 1.0082 ± 0.0007. The mean value of the $\Delta$18OC-P difference is 8.4 ± 0.7‰, close to the literature values given for other species. However, we also show that the values of the $\Delta$18OC-P difference for R. unicornis upper molars can vary on a $\sim$ 2‰ range in the same tooth. We develop a physiological model to explain the origin of inter-species and intra-tooth $\Delta$18OC-P difference and to understand their implications on the status of $\Delta$18OC-P as a tool for identifying diagenesis. The results imply that, by increasing the dataset of phosphate and carbonate oxygen isotopic composition for modern mammal species, we will be able to define a maximal and precise envelope corresponding to the well-preserved samples and to check a possible species dependence on the $\delta$18OC/$\delta$18OP relationship. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Results were compared to other nearby palaeoenvironmental proxies, so a final approximation on the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation that caused the four glacial advance stages is proposed. Glaciers reached their maximum extension at 36 ka, in a cold and dry environment. A second advance stage took place between 18.5 and 19.5 ka, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when glaciers advanced in a wet environment, with positive rainfall anomalies. A third glacial advance was dated during the Oldest Dryas, in which climate shifted to extremely cold and dry conditions. Finally, a last stage has been identified and proposed to the Younger Dryas, in which precipitation anomalies are negligible. Our results confirm some of the previously made palaeoglacial and palaeoenvironmental inferences for the Iberian Peninsula, as well as provide valuable and accurate anomalies, which are useful for climate modelling.},

However, unlike marine and ice core records, terrestrial palaeodata are often not available in databases or in a format that is easily accessible to the non-specialist. As a consequence, many excellent terrestrial records are unknown to the broader palaeoclimate community and are not included in compilations, comparisons, or modelling exercises. Here we present a compilation of Western European terrestrial palaeo-records covering, entirely or partially, the 60-8-ka INTIMATE time period. The compilation contains 56 natural archives, including lake records, speleothems, ice cores, and terrestrial proxies in marine records. The compilation is limited to include records of high temporal resolution and/or records that provide climate proxies or quantitative reconstructions of environmental parameters, such as temperature or precipitation, and that are of relevance and interest to a broader community. We briefly review the different types of terrestrial archives, their respective proxies, their interpretation and their application for palaeoclimatic reconstructions. We also discuss the importance of independent chronologies and the issue of record synchronization. The aim of this exercise is to provide the wider palaeo-community with a consistent compilation of high-quality terrestrial records, to facilitate model-data comparisons, and to identify key areas of interest for future investigations. We use the compilation to investigate Western European latitudinal climate gradients during the deglacial period and, despite of poorly constrained chronologies for the older records, we summarize the main results obtained from NW and SW European terrestrial records before the LGM.},

  abstract   = {The Iberian Peninsula plays a central role in the current debates on the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition and the Neanderthal extinction. This is largely due to the chronological data which some authors have suggested show a clear divide between Northern Iberia, where the Upper Palaeolithic appeared as early as 36.5 ka 14C BP, and Southern Iberia, where the Middle Palaeolithic survived until ca. 32–30 ka 14C BP or later. The best example of this view is the Ebro Frontier hypothesis. However, there are chronological data in both Northern and Southern Iberia that do not fit this pattern, and some of the evidence supporting the Ebro Frontier hypothesis has been questioned in recent years. This paper focuses on the chronology of the final Middle Palaeolithic of Northern Iberia, where several assemblages have been found to post-date the first Upper Palaeolithic in the region, and be of a similar age to the final Neanderthal occupations of the south. In order to improve the chronological framework of the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic boundary in the Northern Iberian Peninsula, a radiocarbon dating program is focused on sites from both the Cantabrian and Mediterranean regions. The first results of this program are presented in this paper. New radiocarbon dates have been measured by two laboratories using a range of pre-treatment methodologies. These do not support a late Middle Palaeolithic in Northern Iberia.},

Extinctions of Arctotertiary woody taxa are recorded during the Early and Middle Pleistocene, but glacial refugia facilitated the survival of a number of temperate, Mediterranean and Ibero-North African woody angiosperms. The responses of Iberian vegetation to climatic changes during the Pleistocene have been spatially and temporarily complex, including rapid changes of vegetation in parallel to orbital and suborbital variability, and situations of multi-centennial resilience or accommodation to climatic changes. Regional characteristics emerged as soon as for the Middle Pleistocene, if not earlier: Ericaceae in the Atlantic coast indicating wetter climate, thermo-mediterranean elements in the south as currently, and broad-leaf trees in the northeastern. Overall, steppe landscapes and open Pinus woodlands prevailed over many continental regions during the cold spells of the Late Pleistocene. The maintenance of a high phytodiversity during the glacials was linked to several refuge zones in the coastal shelves of the Mediterranean and intramountainous valleys. Northern Iberia, especially on coastal areas, was also patched with populations of tree species, and this is not only documented by palaeobotanical data (pollen and charcoal) but also postulated by phylogeographical models.},

  abstract   = {The Northwest of Iberia has yielded one of the most complete European Middle Paleolithic records. Despite this wealth of information, very little is known about population dynamics during this period. For that reason, the main concern of this paper is to provide socio-environmental models that may help explain Early Middle Paleolithic (EMP) population dynamics in NW Iberia, assessing to what extent they were shaped by climate forces. The archaeological record is analyzed on the basis of the heuristics of ecological models, already employed in the European Pleistocene record but never at a regional scale, in order to detect long-term changes in the composition of EMP populations, and the environmental, biological and sociocultural process influencing those changes. According to the models proposed, we have detected a long-term population dynamic between MIS 11 and MIS 6, characterized by low environmental stress, high biological productivity, interaction among populations and sociocultural complexity. Eventually, this population dynamic was broken due to an extreme climate phase in late MIS 6 that had a profound impact on populations and sociocultural structures. As a result, the Upper Pleistocene population of NW Iberia was concentrated in the Cantabrian region. This area became an isolated Neanderthal glacial refugium that hosted a population with different origins and fragile long-term demographic stability.},

  abstract = {The disappearance of Neanderthals from the Palaeolithic record in Europe remains an enigma, even after more than 150 years of research. This paper identifies Rapid Climate Change during the Glacial period as a major factor that influences a variety of cultural, economic and demographic processes during the European Palaeolithic. In particular, and in agreement with many previous authors, climatic deterioration is put forward to explain multiple population breakdown during the European Palaeolithic, as well as to explain corresponding major cultural changes. Taking the archaeological record of the Iberian Peninsula as a case study, the Repeated Replacement Model (RRM) is proposed to explain population turnover in Europe during the most extreme climatic phases of the Glacial, the occurrence of North Atlantic Heinrich Events (HE). The strong aridity of the Mediterranean during HEs appears to have limited settlement refugia to such an extreme extent that communication networks and cultural traditions broke down and were subsequently reorganized under different socio-cultural conditions. The transition from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Aurignacian during HE 4 is one of these cultural turnover periods, which saw the final (macro-scale) extinction of Neanderthals and their widespread replacement by Anatomically Modern Humans. More specifically, and recognizable by comparisons with other climatically extreme Glacial periods (i.e. HE 3, and HE 2), the model excludes the survival of geographically wider (supra-regional) human networks, but it does allow for (micro-scale) survival of scattered groups. From this model, some kind of admixture between Neanderthals and incoming groups of modern humans would indeed have been possible on a small scale. If this climatic scenario turns out to be correct, the most spectacular thing about Neanderthal disappearance might actually lie in the seemingly unspectacular nature of the processes involved.},

The planktonic oxygen isotope record of this core, reflecting predominantly sea surface temperature (SST), shows a pattern of millennial-scale oscillations that is very similar to climatic changes recorded by the Greenland ice core records over the same interval. In turn, tree populations show a pattern of rapid expansions and contractions that follow the pronounced and abrupt isotopic shifts recorded offshore. Through Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, this millennial-scale pattern of vegetation change, alternating between steppe and open woodland, is superimposed on a longer-term pattern of shrinking ericaceous heathland and decreasing size of successive interstadial tree populations. Trees persisted during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), at greater abundance than during many of the coldest episodes of MIS 3. This agrees with the marine data which indicate that LGM sea surface temperatures here were significantly warmer than the minima recorded in MIS 3. Our combined marine-terrestrial record, together with data from nearby sequences, provides a stepping stone between terrestrial sequences and the Greenland ice core and North Atlantic marine records. This will permit a better understanding of the behaviour of vegetation across different regions at several scales of climatic forcing.},

  abstract   = {The Iberian Peninsula is almost surrounded by the sea and is topographically and ecologically variable. These factors will have impacted on both the distribution and dispersal patterns of large mammals (including hominins) within Iberia, and are considered in detail in this paper. There are two routes of mammalian dispersal into Iberia: across the Pyrenees and across the Gibraltar Strait. With an increasing interest in the possible use of coastlines by early hominins the latter route has been the focus of much discussion. However, the arguments are limited by the relative lack of hominin remains and archaeology from the Early Pleistocene. This paper takes a wider perspective to hominin dispersals by examining what is known of the evolution and movements of other taxa in Iberia and how these may inform our understanding of the hominin fossil record. Beginning by briefly reviewing the present day and Pleistocene glacial and interglacial vegetation of Iberia, it then considers the large-mammal fauna. Particular attention is paid to the potential routes of movement for terrestrial animals in and out of the peninsula, and the evidence for each route is assessed. Iberia was a refuge for temperate species during the Quaternary glacial cycles and movements of Quaternary faunas are reviewed in the light of modern phylogeographic analyses and studies of fossil assemblages. Iberian faunas are highly variable, with some absences of otherwise widespread European animals, but cold-phase taxa such as reindeer and woolly rhinoceros did cross the Pyrenees. It seems that the large mountain ranges were less a barrier for the dispersal of these taxa than the line which today forms the limit of the summer drought. Iberia also provided the last refuge for extinct species such as the Neanderthals and endangered extant species such as the Iberian lynx.},

  abstract   = {Coastal areas as reservoirs of resources for hominid groups have been widely studied in recent years. These areas combine marine with terrestrial and wetland resources and would have been optimum sites for hominids, including Neanderthals. This is the case with the Cova del Gegant, a cave that today opens directly onto the Mediterranean Sea and is located in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula. The geomorphological evolution of the Massis del Garraf has provided evidence that during the late Pleistocene there was a littoral platform between 8 and 13 km wide in front of the Cova del Gegant. Within this framework, the data derived from analysis of the small vertebrates and large mammals recovered from Cova del Gegant, including taxa currently absent from the Massis del Garraf, suggest that the landscape surrounding the cave provided a richer terrestrial ecosystem for Neanderthals than is available in this zone today. Analysis of the small-vertebrate association from the cave reveals that the landscape surrounding the cave was dominated by woodland-edge and open environments and that the climate was Mediterranean. The results have been compared with the only Iberian site with similar characteristics to the Cova del Gegant, Gorham's cave (southern Iberia, Gibraltar), revealing differences and similarities in the landscape and climate on the basis of the small-mammal assemblages as well as the differences in the accessibility to terrestrial mammalian resources for the Neanderthal groups. The landscape and the climate were reasonably similar at the two sites, but the differences in the accessibility of resources for the Neanderthals are directly related to the location of the sites and the coastal position. Whereas the Cova del Gegant was on a route of mammal migration (between the Ebro Valley and France) suited for securing terrestrial resources, Gorham's cave is located on a small peninsula with a lower abundance of terrestrial mammal resources. This is probably why the Neanderthal groups at Gorham's cave exploited marine resources, whereas there is no evidence of marine resources having been exploited at Cova del Gegant, even though the seashore was nearby.

Pour chacun des deux niveaux, la présence de carnivores est importante, et pour cela les interactions entre humains, herbivores et carnivores ont été évaluées d’un point de vue taphonomique. De cette manière, nous pourrons déchiffrer le rôle joué par chacun d’eux sur les accumulations des restes de faune. D’autre part, l’industrie lithique a été analysée en adoptant différents points de vue : la matière première, les systèmes de fabrication, la typologie et l’utilisation. Ces informations ont été utilisées pour caractériser le système de gestion employé et préciser les activités réalisées sur chacun des sites. Les résultats combinés des analyses industrielles et taphonomiques nous permettent d’évaluer les deux occupations comme des haltes de chasse. À partir de cette lecture, nous pouvons proposer des interprétations sur les stratégies de gestion du territoire pendant le Châtelperronien et sur les implications de ces stratégies dans la compréhension de la transition du Paléolithique Moyen au Paléolithique Supérieur et le remplacement des peuples néandertaliens de Cantabrie orientale et du Sud-Ouest de la France. In this paper, we present two sites with evidences of ephemeral occupations dating to the Chatelperronian: Labeko Koba IX and Ekain X. In both levels carnivore presence is abundant. For this reason the interactions between humans, carnivores and herbivores are investigated from a taphonomic point of view in order to clarify the origin of faunal accumulation. Lithic industry is also analyzed from different perspectives: raw material acquisition, fabrication system, typology and use. These data have been used to characterize lithic provisioning strategies and to precise the range of activities performed in the site. The combination of thaponomic and industrial data suggest that both sites served as hunting camps. Starting from this interpretation we can assess the territory management strategies practiced during the Chatelperronian and the implication of this in the understanding of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic Transition and the replacement of Neanderthal populations in eastern Cantabrian region and Sud-Ouest of France.},

  abstract = {The use of caves during the Late Middle and Early Upper Palaeolithic in Europe was often characterized by alternation between humans (Neandertals and Anatomically Modern Humans) and carnivores. One of the most important karstic areas in Europe that contains a rich archaeological record during this cultural period is the Cantabrian Region, northern Spain. We explore the archaeological evidence recovered from the lower levels of the stratigraphic sequence in El Mirón Cave dated between 27 and 48ka cal BP – Gravettian and Mousterian in age. Zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses of the limited number of mammal bones, together with the small lithic artefact assemblages, suggest brief human occupations after which the carcass remains left by humans and, composed mainly of Spanish ibex, red deer and some leporids, were scavenged by carnivores. Carnivores were probably also agents of accumulation, especially in the two lowest layers in which artifacts are most scarce. Notable palaeontological finds include remains of mammoth and leopard. Stable isotopic analyses of Spanish ibex remains provide information of relatively open landscape and suggest that cooler conditions prevailed during the Early Upper Palaeolithic. The results of this research offer an insight on the type of cave use by humans and carnivores during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic and a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction at the time late Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans inhabited in the Cantabrian region.},

  abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is key for the study of the transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, as well as for the replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans (AMH). On this subject, the most widespread misconception assumed that both human species coexisted during a certain period of time, after which Homo sapiens imposed on Neanderthals who finally got extinct. However, recent proposals based on improved dating methods, discuss this possibility, arguing that the arrival of AMH was marked by the complete absence of Homo neanderthalensis in this territory. In that way, new theories deny the possibility of coexistence and the disappearance of Neanderthals by cultural displacement. Covalejos Cave (Velo, Pielagos, Cantabria), one of the few settlements in the northern Peninsula with Final Mousterian and Early Aurignacian levels, supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, in this paper, we try to avoid a direct discussion about this question in order to centre our analysis on identifying possible different subsistence strategies between H. neanderthalensis and anatomically modern humans in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Our zooarchaeological and taphonomic studies reflect that Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans exploited the same faunal species, pointing out that there does not seem to be significant differences in their behaviour in Covalejos Cave.},

  abstract = {The sites of La Viña and Llonin have an important archaeological sequence corresponding to Marine Isotope Stage 3: Mousterian, Aurignacian and Gravettian periods. La Viña is a complex rock shelter with continuous occupations, being some (basically the Mousterian and the Aurignacian in contact levels) altered by post-depositional processes as a consequence of the irregular bedrock morphology and the type of processes involved. The cave of Llonin mainly consists of occasional human/carnivores occupations during the Mousterian and the Gravettian. The current multidisciplinary research has allowed us to obtain and match several preliminary data: site formation processes, fauna and stable isotopes, vegetation, radiocarbon dating, shell ornaments, lithic raw materials and technology, offering an interesting field of study of two relatively distant ecological niches: open river valley (La Viña) and mountainous (Llonin). During the Mousterian, the faunal composition of La Viña is scarce but dominated by red deer and followed by chamois, while large mammals are absent. At the Aurignacian, red deer and chamois are also represented within a larger assemblage, together with a low representation of other taxa such as horse, bovines, Spanish ibex and roe deer. Conversely, in Llonin chamois and Spanish ibex dominate during the Mousterian, followed by red deer. Carnivores are few in La Viña they are represented by bear, fox and wolf; while in Llonin they are larger and other species are included, mainly leopard and hyena with a main role in the formation of the faunal assemblages and alternating their occupation of the cave with the Neandertals. On the other hand, the ungulates from La Viña are anthropogenically modified not only during the Mousterian but also the Aurignacian and Gravettian in contrast to Llonin, were these modifications are lower than those generated by the carnivores. Firewood and micromammals analysis show an open landscape, dominated by heliophilous, pioneering species characteristic of the montane biogeographical belt. Sorbus, birch and Scots pine are especially important as well as a shurbland mainly dominated by leguminous. The environment seems to be more arid and open in Mousterian levels, more forested and humid during the Aurignacian and cold, namely climatic recrudescence, in the Gravettian. Shells are only present in the Aurignacian and the Gravettian of La Viña with other purposes than strictly bromatological. Local quartzite is the main raw material in both sites during MIS3. However, during the Aurignacian and the Gravettian, flint is broadly incorporated for blade and bladelet production. In this regard, local, semilocal and foreign flints are carried to the sites, mainly Piloña and Flysch flints. The preliminary assessment of inter-stratigraphical contamination between the Aurignacian and the Gravettian in the long sequence of La Viña shows no lithic refits, and therefore no interstratigraphic contamination, in agreement with the previous techno-typological studies. The radiocarbon dating fits into the current chronological framework of the Cantabrian region.},

Making use of the preserved animal and human tooth and bone commonly found at archaeological sites, applications include the reconstruction of palaeoclimate and palaeoseasonality; animal husbandry and management practices; human and animal lifetime mobility and provenance; and cultural practices such as breastfeeding, weaning and even past culinary preparation techniques. With a range of other uses across the natural, physical, chemical and biological sciences, oxygen isotope analyses are also highly cross-disciplinary, with developments in the field of isotope bioarchaeology potentially feeding into other fields and vice-versa. The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of the biogeochemical background of oxygen isotope systematics from the water cycle to human and animal skeletal tissues for archaeologists and other scientists, and to explore how these have been utilised in terrestrial bioarchaeological research. In this way, we aim to provide an overview resource for stable isotope analysts in archaeology and the wider earth science community, as well as for archaeological practitioners and consumers interested in specific applications. By providing a summary of fundamental isotope mechanics alongside a review of recent developments in the field, we hope to highlight the potential of oxygen isotope bioarchaeology to not only reveal environmental and ecological aspects of the past relevant to human groups using archaeological materials, but also to illuminate past human decisions and behaviours. Current limitations and caveats of the approaches used are also explored.},

  abstract = {The oxygen isotope composition of human phosphatic tissues ($\delta$18OP) has great potential for reconstructing climate and population migration, but this technique has not been applied to early human evolution. To facilitate this application we analyzed $\delta$18OP values of modern human teeth collected at 12 sites located at latitudes ranging from 4°N to 70°N together with the corresponding oxygen composition of tap waters ($\delta$18OW) from these areas. In addition, the $\delta$18O of some raw and boiled foods were determined and simple mass balance calculations were performed to investigate the impact of solid food consumption on the oxygen isotope composition of the total ingested water (drinking water + solid food water). The results, along with those from three, smaller published data sets, can be considered as random estimates of a unique $\delta$18OW/$\delta$18OP linear relationship: $\delta$18OW = 1.54(±0.09) × $\delta$18OP-33.72(±1.51) (R2 = 0.87: p [H0:R2 = 0] = 2 × 10-19). The $\delta$18O of cooked food is higher than that of the drinking water. As a consequence, in a modern diet the $\delta$18O of ingested water is +1.05 to 1.2‰ higher than that of drinking water in the area. In meat-dominated and cereal-free diets, which may have been the diets of some of our early ancestors, the shift is a little higher and the application of the regression equation would slightly overestimate $\delta$18OW in these cases. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Oxygen and hydrogen isotope signatures of animal tissues are strongly correlated with the isotope signature of local precipitation and as a result, isotope signatures of tissues are commonly used to study resource utilization and migration in animals and to reconstruct climate. To better understand the mechanisms behind these correlations, we manipulated the isotope composition of the drinking water and food supplied to captive woodrats to quantify the relationships between drinking water (??dw), body water (??bw), and tissue (??t). Woodrats were fed an isotopically constant food but were supplied with isotopically depleted or enriched water. Some animals were switched between these waters, allowing simultaneous determination of body water turnover, isotope change recorded in teeth and hair, and fractional contributions of atmospheric O2, drinking water, and food to the oxygen and hydrogen budgets of the animals. The half-life of the body water turnover was 3-6 days. A mass balance model estimated that drinking water, atmospheric O2, and food were responsible for 56%, 30%, and 15% of the oxygen in the body water, respectively. Drinking water and food were responsible for 71% and 29% of the hydrogen in the body water, respectively. Published generalized models for lab rats and humans accurately estimated ??bw, as did an updated version of a specific model for woodrats. The change in drinking water was clearly recorded in hair and tooth enamel, and multiple-pool and tooth enamel forward models closely predicted these changes in hair and enamel, respectively. Oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the drinking water strongly influence the composition of the body water and tissues such as hair and tooth enamel; however, food and atmospheric O2 also contribute oxygen and/or hydrogen atoms to tissue. Controlled experiments allow researchers to validate models that estimate ??t based on ??dw and so will increase the reliability of estimates of resource utilization and climate reconstruction. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Data from unshaded feedlot pens (up to 24 pens utilized per study; 6 to 9 animals{\textperiodcentered}pen-1) containing predominantly Angus crossbred cattle were obtained by dividing total water intake by the number of animals utilizing that waterer. Each waterer was shared by 2 pens; therefore, data were derived from a database containing 72 experimental units comprising 144 pen records. Climatic data were compiled from weather stations located at the feedlot facility. The database included daily measures of mean ambient (Ta), maximum (Tmax), and minimum (Tmin) temperature (°C), precipitation, relative humidity (%), wind speed (m{\textperiodcentered}s-1), solar radiation (SR, W{\textperiodcentered}m-2), and temperaturehumidity index (THI), as well as DMI (kg{\textperiodcentered}d-1) and DWI (L{\textperiodcentered}d-1). Simple and multiple regression analyses were conducted by season and for the overall data set. Results confirmed that DWI increases during the summer (P < 0.01). When seasons were combined and analyzed by linear regression, the best predictors of DWI were THI (r2 = 0.57), Ta (r2 = 0.57), Tmin (r2 = 0.56), and Tmax (r2 = 0.54). In multiple regression analyses, smaller coefficients of determination (R2 < 0.25) were found within summer and winter seasons. Across season, the largest R2 (0.65) were obtained from the following prediction equations: 1) DWI = 5.92 + (1.03{\textperiodcentered}DMI) + (0.04{\textperiodcentered}SR) + (0.45{\textperiodcentered}Tmin); and 2) DWI = -7.31 + (1.00{\textperiodcentered}DMI) + (0.04{\textperiodcentered}SR) + (0.30{\textperiodcentered}THI). In conclusion, Ta, Tmin, and THI were found to be the primary factors that influence DWI in finishing cattle, whereas SR and DMI were found to have a smaller influence on DWI. {\textcopyright}2011 American Society of Animal Science.},

The new ??18O data was combined with records of oxygen isotope values from earlier investigations on European mammoth tooth enamel and palaeogroundwaters to study the spatial patterns and temporal variations in the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and the thermal climate over much of Europe. The reconstructed geographical distribution of ??18O in precipitation during 52-24 ka reflects the progressive isotopic depletion of air masses moving northeast, consistent with a westerly source of moisture for the entire region, and a circulation pattern similar to that of the present-day. Regional long-term average ??18Ow values were 0.6-4.1??? lower than at present, the largest changes recorded for the currently maritime influenced southern Sweden and the Baltic region. The application of regionally varied ??/T-slopes, estimated from palaeogroundwater data and modern correlations, yield reasonable estimates of glacial surface temperatures in Europe and imply 2-9 ??C lower long-term mean annual surface temperatures during the glacial period. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Modern equid teeth were analyzed to estimate a relationship between ??8OP04 and environment water. Multiple samples of seven different fossil species from Burge Quarry, a ??? 12 Ma attritional fossil deposit, indicate the diagenetic overprints exist but can be detected by decreased P concentration and increased crystallinity relative to modern enamel. Isotopic variation for the pristine samples from Burge Quarry is ??1.5% (1??, n=9), which may represent the resolution of the procedure within a stratigraphic horizon. There are no apparent correlations with body size, hypsodonty, or phylogeny. A range of 7%0 in ??18OP04 occurs over the 10 m.y. interval. A trend towards depleted ??18OP04 of about 4% corresponds to a depletion of up to 6%0 in ??18O of precipitation between 18.2 and 8.5 Ma, but the range of variation of Burge is large relative to the climate signal. Our results demonstrate that ??18OP04 should be useful in quantitatively reconstructing Cenozoic continental paleoclimate on 106-year timescales. Isotopic variation due to taphonomic bias and the terrestrial rock record will likely obscure higher-order climate signals. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Variation in the concentration of the stable isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon have been tested in continental records as tools for quantitative or semi-quantitative paleoclimatological studies. Among the different methods, the potential use of oxygen isotopes in mammal bone and tooth phosphate has recently been recognized. Measurements carried out on fossil mammal bones of Holocene age and their paleoclimatological interpretation corresponded well with paleontological and paleobotanical records. In the case of considerably older fossils, diagenetic processes may change the primary oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate. Fossil horse bones and teeth (principally of the species Equus stenonis) were studied to ascertain how far back in time fossil mammal remains may be considered reliable material for paleoclimatological studies. The samples come from 13 different locations in southeastern Spain, their age ranging from Maspinian (late Pleistocene) to Middle Villafranchian (Pliocene). Apart from the variations of the $\delta$18O(PO43-) values which may be related to climatic changes, it is apparent that the isotopic composition of bones and teeth from the same deposit are frequently rather different from one another. The isotopic differences range from a few tenths of one % to several %. This suggests a strong influence of taphonomy over the measured isotopic values of fossils in each deposit. Time can be considered neither the only variable nor the most important one responsible for the change of the primary isotopic composition of fossils. Under these conditions it is rather difficult to establish lower or upper limits for the age of fossils to be studied for reliable paleoclimatological information since the limits are directly related to taphonomic history. This, in turn, is related to local environmental conditions and not only to the age of fossils. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

This knowledge is important for the understanding of the behaviour of the mineral under physiological and patho- logical conditions. In this study literature data on the composition and par- ticle size of the mineral are reviewed. Their predominantly apatitic nature goes back to hydroxyapatite as their prototype. However, other calcium phospha- tes, like whitlockite, are also important. The various analytical data on the content of Ca, P, Na, Mg and CO3 as the main components were analyzed for their consistency with a model of variable phase composition of the mineral. This analysis revealed that the probable phase composition of the mineral in dentin and bone is the same, but different from that in tooth enamel. Studies on the solubility behaviour indicate that near the physiological pH (7.4) all phases are solubility controlling simultaneously. This supports a physiological model according to which the body fluids are close to physicochemical equilibrium with bone mineral. Hence, changes in the chemical and phase composition of the mineral which occur under pathological conditions are related to changes in the activities of the relevant components in the surrounding body fluid. The latter depend mainly on cellular activity and organic transport activity. Atten- tion is also paid to the anticariogenic effect of fluoride and the incorpora- tion of that component in the mineral of fluorotic bone. This study is closed with some remarks about the use of synthetic analogues of biominerals as implants in dentistry and surgery.},

  abstract  = {The accuracy of paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on isotope analyses of equid teeth is currently uncertain because the exact relationship between the isotope composition of modern feral equids and their environment has not been thoroughly studied. We analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotope values ($\delta$13C and $\delta$18O) of tooth enamel carbonate and the $\delta$13C values of fecal samples from modern feral horses. We compared those values with the $\delta$13C values of local vegetation and the $\delta$18O values of local waters. Herds were studied in two contrasting localities: eastern Oregon, where grasslands consisted of 100% C3species, and New Mexico, where >95% of the grasses were C4species. Carbon isotope analyses of fecal material and tooth enamel suggest that horses consumed primarily grass, but some New Mexico horses also consumed significant amounts of shrubs and/or forbs. Microhistological analyses of fecal samples show that Oregon horses consumed 95% grass, and Oregon enamel $\delta$13C values are consistent with a diet containing 100% C3plants. Microhistological analyses of fecal samples from New Mexico indicate a diet averaging 75% grass, while enamel $\delta$13C values suggest that diets averaged 85% C4plants (range=72-97%). Thus, reconstructions of the C3/C4ratio of grasses in ancient grasslands that are based on the $\delta$13C values of fossil equid teeth may underestimate the abundance of C4grasses. The mean $\delta$18O values of tooth enamel paralleled the trends observed in the mean $\delta$18O values of precipitation. However, the mean $\delta$18O values of enamel carbonate from Oregon and New Mexico differed by only 3.3‰, which is less than the difference in the mean $\delta$18O values of precipitation (6.5‰). In addition, the range of $\delta$18O values within New Mexico enamel samples (6.5‰) was greater than the difference between mean enamel $\delta$18O values at each site. Calculated values for the $\delta$18O of water ingested by horses are 2-3‰ more positive than mean $\delta$18O values for corresponding precipitation, suggesting that horses consumed waters that were enriched in18O due to evaporation. While our results confirm that local climatic and hydrological conditions can influence the $\delta$18O values of equid enamel, they also show that the $\delta$18O values of equid teeth are not always a direct proxy for the isotope ratios of precipitation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Data on European cattle (Bos taurus) and Indian cattle (Bos indicus) formed separate curves, of which the former is used to estimate water intake of cattle of the familiar breeds. A formula is used to convert water intake of lactating cows to levels comparable to those of dry animals under like conditions of body size, nutrition and air temperature. Positive relationships that have been reported between salt or protein contents of rations are cited to indicate how water intake is influenced by these nutrients. Tables are given showing estimated levels of water intake of cattle, the estimated levels compared with the actual water intake levels used as the basis of this study, and actual intake of a limited number of beef animals under feed-lot and range conditions. Water requirements of cattle in feed lots can be reduced during brief periods of water shortage by a reduction in dry matter intake.},

Three distinct patterns of delta(P) variation are found in modern and fossil jaws. Each pattern cart be related to the season of birth. An oxygen isotope mass balance model that incorporates seasonality and nursing of foals during tooth enamel mineralization is used to interpret the delta(P) pattern, along the toothrow. The range of delta(P) for the same tooth position. among ''Merychippus'' primus jaws from Thomson Quarry is relatively small (2.2 parts per thousand), and the cheek tooth delta(P) pattern is similar among individual jaws. This is comparable to a modern living population and consistent with a taphonomic interpretation of catastrophic accumulation for the Thomson ''M.'' primus population. The range of delta(P) for the same tooth position. among Pseudhipparion retrusum jaws from Burge Quarry is Larger (4 parts per thousand), and the cheek tooth delta(P) patterns are not similar among individual jaws. This is consistent with an attritional accumulation over a long period of time. Such wide ranges in delta(P) limit application to continental paleoclimate reconstruction because of the low signal to noise ratio.},

  abstract   = {The sulfur isotope composition (δ34S) of available su lfate was measured for 44 soils developed on volcanic ashes and basaltic terrains in Japan, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Chile. Native soil sulfates are a mixture of seaspray (δ34S = +20‰) and anthropogenic (around + 5‰ on average) sulfates. The isotopic values are generally higher in areas of the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. Such a hemispheric difference is due to differences in the relative contribution of sulfur from marine aerosols and human activity. Native Japanese soil samples collected at the sites more than 16 km inland from the coastal line tend to show lower δ34S values (+ 1.7 to +8.9‰), compared to those from the coastal regions (+ 10.9 to + 17.5‰). Dominance of anthropogenic sulfur in the Japanese islands apparently existed as early as the early 1950's. Application of chemical fertilizers rich in sulfur has modified the sulfur isotope composition of native soils. Ammonium sulfate and single superphosphate from the current market in Japan have relatively low δ34S values (−4.9 to + 10.2‰), which reflect sulfur sources from crude oils and ore sulfides. In contrast, sulfur in fertilizers commonly used in New Zealand and elemental sulfur in sulfur-fortified single superphosphate from Australia gave higher δ34S values (+ 15.7 to +20.7‰). Extensive application of sulfur in the form of fertilizers, as in Japan and New Zealand, affects the sulfur isotope composition of arable soils.},

  abstract = {This study presents sulfur isotope compositions (δ34S) for plants grown in a series of growth chamber and field experiments under controlled conditions. Maize, beans, and squash fertilized with a marine fertilizer (seabird guano) were significantly enriched in 34S relative to the unfertilized control plants (by +4.0 to +7.2‰) in the growth chamber experiments. No 34S enrichment was detected in the plants from the field experiment, which likely relates to the recent use of ammonium sulfate fertilizer in these fields and the retention of residual sulfate with a comparatively low δ34S. The field experiment provided a basis to estimate the apparent fractionation between soil and plant S associated with uptake and assimilation (Δ34S), which ranged between −4 and −6‰ depending on the taxon and tissue. The use of marine fertilizers has the capacity to increase plant δ34S values and complicate quantitative reconstructions of ancient diet based on bulk stable isotope data.},

  abstract  = {The stable isotope composition of biogenic apatite is an important geochemical marker that can record environmental parameters and is widely used to infer past climates, biomineralization processes, dietary preferences and habitat of vertebrates. In this study, theoretical equilibrium isotopic fractionation of oxygen, carbon and calcium in hydroxyapatite and carbonate-bearing hydroxyapatite is investigated using first-principles methods based on density-functional theory and compared to the theoretical isotopic fractionation properties of calcite, CO2 and H2O. Considering the variability of apatite crystal-chemistry, special attention is given to specific contributions of crystal sites to isotopic fractionation. Significant internal fractionation is calculated for oxygen and carbon isotopes in CO3 between the different structural sites occupied by carbonate groups in apatite (typically 7‰ for both 18O/16O and 13C/12C fractionation at 37 °C). Compared with calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation, occurrence of A-type substitution in apatite structure, in addition to the main B-type substitution, could explain the larger temperature dependence of oxygen isotope fractionation measured at low temperature between carbonate in apatite and water. Theoretical internal fractionation of oxygen isotopes between carbonate and phosphate in B-type carbonated apatite (∼8‰ at 37 °C) is consistent with experimental values obtained from modern and well-preserved fossil bio-apatites. Concerning calcium, theoretical results suggest a small fractionation between apatite and calcite (−0.17‰ at 37 °C). Internal fractionation reaching 0.8‰ at 37 °C occurs between the two Ca sites in hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, the Ca isotopic fractionation properties of apatite are affected by the occurrence of carbonate groups, which could contribute to the variability observed on natural samples. Owing to the complexity of apatite crystal-chemistry and in light of the theoretical results, measurements of site-specific isotopic fractionation properties could improve our understanding and the interpretation of isotopic records in apatites.},

This study examines carbon and oxygen isotope values from collagen and hydroxyapatite (structural carbonate and phosphate) in archaeological human bones and teeth to derive species-specific correlation equations and isotope spacing values. The d13Ccollagen and d13Cstructural carbonate in bone and dentin collagen show a strong correlation (R=0.87, 0.90, respectively) with an average$\Delta$13Ccarb-coll spacing of 5.4%. The consistency of this isotope spacingwith other largemammals andin humans with both lowandhigh protein intake (as indicatedby enriched d15N values) suggests a similar allocation of protein-derived carbon and whole diet-derived carbon to collagen and structural carbonates, respectively, as other terrestrial mammals regardless of absolute meat intake. The d18Ostructural carbonate and d18Ophosphate show the strongest correlation in enamel (R= 0.65),weaker correlations in dentin (R = 0.59) and bone (R = 0.35), with an average $\Delta$18Ocarb-phos of 7.8%.Thisisotope spacingisslightly lower than previously reported for large mammals and limited available data for humans. The results potentially indicate species-specific fractionations and differing access to body water and blood-dissolved inorganic carbo- nates in the presence of collagen formation. The use of correlation between d18O structural carbonate and d18O phosphate to determine diagenetic state is not recommended. The strength of this correlation observed in bones and teeth is variable and alternate indicators of diagenetic state (i.e. C:N ratios of collagen) provide more robust and independent evidence of isotope preservation despite presence/absence of a strong isotope correlation.

By comparing the European human values with marine faunal values, and values of marine-diet humans from North America, we propose that the marine component of human diet in the Late European Mesolithic was based mainly on marine fish, with only minor contributions from shellfish or marine mammals.},

The older method (as practised at the University of Cape Town) demineralizes bone 'chunks', while the newer method (as practised at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig) involves demineralization, gelatinization and ultra-filtration to select only higher molecular weight protein fragments for isotopic analysis. The latter method was developed for problematic (i.e. poorly-preserved) samples and while it is more rigorous, it is also significantly more expensive and more labor-intensive. Our aim is to find out whether there is any difference between the $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N of bone collagen isolated from relatively well-preserved bones using the two methods. Our sample set consists of 5 modern and 47 archaeological animal and human bones from the southern and western parts of South Africa. Archaeological specimens range in age from a few hundred to approximately six thousand years old. Collagen was extracted, its quality assessed using %C, %N and C:N, and $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values measured independently in both laboratories. There are no statistically significant differences between the sets of $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values from the two laboratories. For relatively well-preserved bones, the 'chunk' method of collagen preparation continues to be an acceptable alternative to more sophisticated collagen extraction protocols for C and N isotope analysis. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

The study consisted of human palaeodiet characterization and mobility patterns based on δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, and 87Sr/86Sr isotope analyses. Carbon and nitrogen values showed a staple diet derived from husbandry based on the consumption of animal protein (pig, poultry and sheep/goat) and cereals (millet and wheat). The increase in the consumption of millet rather than wheat during the High Middle Ages is noteworthy. The change in dietary pattern coincided with the transformation of the landscape from dispersed farmsteads to the foundation of a village, leading to landscape reorganization. This new situation resulted in the gradual abandonment of San Juan de Momoitio church and the graveyard. Oxygen and strontium isotopes show that most individuals were of local origin except for only two individuals. Strontium isotopes also recorded the population distribution after the village foundation and the subsequent landscape arrangement, reflecting the relative movement of individuals towards higher hillsides. Additionally, the oxygen isotopes of teeth recorded climate changes throughout the time of the settlement, suggesting variation from warmer climate conditions during the first occupation period towards colder climate conditions in the last period. Nitrogen and oxygen isotope composition also contributed to a better understanding of breastfeeding and weaning practices affecting infant peasants in the Middle Ages.},

The intactness and purity of the extracted gelatin ('collagen') is strongly dependent on the extent of diagenetic degradation, contamination and the type of extraction method. Possible chemical, elemental and isotopic parameters for the assessment of 'collagen' quality are discussed. The most important distinction that can be made is the one between contaminated bone (mostly from temperature zones), and bone low in collagen content (mostly from arid and tropical zones). The latter shows more variability in all quality parameters than the former. The natural level of contamination is mostly so low that stable isotopic measurements are not impaired, although14C measurements can be. It is concluded that there is no unequivocal way to detect natural levels of contamination with the discussed parameters, although their use can identify many cases. In low 'collagen' bone, the parameters can identify the great majority of problematic samples: although deviations in these parameters do not necessarily mean isotopic alterations, the increased background found in these samples makes most samples unusable.},

We provide elemental data from different methods (DNA sequences, amino acid sequences and mass spectrometric measurements) which are used to establish a reliable system of quality criteria for sulphur isotope analyses of bone collagen. The difference in the amount of sulphur from fish and mammalian collagen type I led to the suggestion to use different criteria to assess the in vivo character of the collagen between these two categories. For establishing quality ranges, the bone collagen of 140 modern animals were analysed. The amount of sulphur in fish and mammalian bone collagen is 0.63 ± 0.08\% and 0.28 ± 0.07\%, respectively. Based on these results we define for mammalian bone collagen an atomic C:S ratio of 600 ± 300 and an atomic N:S ratio of 200 ± 100, and for fish bone an atomic C:S ratio of 175 ± 50 and an atomic N:S ratio of 60 ± 20.

abstract = {Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of mammalian carnivoran and herbivore species from the late Pleistocene Valdegoba cave site in northern Spain imply competition and partitioning in resource use. In general, the data support the previously recognized ecology for the analyzed species. $\delta$13C values show that the ecosystem around the cave was dominated by C3 plants. The observed $\delta$18O values are similar to what is found in modern environments. The analyzed bovids, Bos primigenius, Capra pyrenaica, and Rupicapra rupicapra, showed the most positive $\delta$13C values. Bos primigenius had the most positive mean carbon isotope value and is suggested to feed on grasses in open environments. Values for Capra pyrenaica primarily indicate grass feeding, while Rupicapra rupicapra had the widest diet for the analyzed species, likely including grass and browse. Cervus elaphus, Equus ferus, Equus hydruntinus, and Stephanorhinus hemitoechus displayed more negative $\delta$13C values indicating the use of similar resources. The smallest species analyzed, Castor fiber, displayed the most negative $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values, implying a preference for eating C3 plants and being semi-aquatic. The canids, Canis lupus and Vulpes vulpes, displayed the most positive $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values, and overlap many of the sampled ungulate species. Positive $\delta$18O values in canids implies that this group obtains much of its water from its prey, uses a different water source, or has physiological differences from the other carnivorans that influence oxygen isotope values. Lynx pardinus had values similar to the canids. Crocuta crocuta had $\delta$13C values more negative than expected for a generalist predator. These values are likely due to concentration of diet on taxa from more forested environments. The most negative $\delta$13C values are observed in the bears, Ursus arctos and Ursus spelaeus. These values are the likely result of hibernation and the inclusion of significant vegetation in bear diets.},

  abstract  = {The transition from the Middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) to the Upper Palaeolithic (Aurignacian) has been one of the prominent themes in the archaeology of the European Palaeolithic for more than 20 years. One of the most controversial questions concerning this period is the extinction of the Neanderthals and their replacement by modern humans. In this context, Cueva del Conde, located in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula, is an archaeo-palaeontological site that records the Mousterian to Aurignacian transition. It has been excavated since the beginning of the 20th century, first by the Conde de la Vega del Sella and systematically by a team from the University of Oviedo since 2001. Three main zones have been identified: the External Zone, dated to approximately 39 110 ± 520 BP (level N104); the Entrance Platform, dated between 38 250 ± 390 BP and 34 730 ± 500 BP; and Gallery A with a radiocarbon date of approximately 31 540 ± 400 BP (level N2a2). The small-vertebrate assemblages recovered from the water-screening of all sediment from the excavation campaigns represent at least 21 small mammal, amphibian and squamate taxa. The small-vertebrate associations in the three zones suggest a patchy landscape, dominated by humid meadows and woodland areas with the existence of water in the vicinity of the cave. The climate shows a more continental pattern during the Mousterian, though it was milder during the Aurignacian. The small vertebrates of the Cueva del Conde Mousterian and Aurignacian levels suggest a climate that differed from modern day temperatures, between -1.1 and -4.4 °C (mean annual temperature), placing these assemblages during Interstadials 9 to 7 (Is9 to 7). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The utility of stable isotopes as tracers of the water molecule has a long pedigree. The study reported here is part of an attempt to establish a comprehensive isotopic 'baseline' for the British Isles as background data for a range of applications. Part 1 of this study (Darling and Talbot, 2003) considered the isotopic composition of rainfall in Britain and Ireland. The present paper is concerned with the composition of surface waters and groundwater. In isotopic terms, surface waters (other than some upland streams) are poorly characterised in the British Isles; their potential variability has yet to be widely used as an aid in hydrological research. In what may be the first study of a major British river, a monthly isotopic record of the upper River Thames during 1998 was obtained. This shows high damping of the isotopic variation compared to that in rainfall over most of the year, though significant fluctuations were seen for the autumn months. Smaller rivers such as the Stour and Darent show a more subdued response to the balance between runoff and baseflow. The relationship between the isotopic composition of rainfall and groundwater is also considered. From a limited database, it appears that whereas Chalk groundwater is a representative mixture of weighted average annual rainfall, for Triassic sandstone groundwater there is a seasonal selection of rainfall biased towards isotopically-depleted winter recharge. This may be primarily the result of physical differences between the infiltration characteristics of rock types, though other factors (vegetation, glacial history) could be involved. In the main, however, groundwaters appear to be representative of bulk rainfall within an error band of 0.5‰ $\delta$ 18 O. Contour maps of the $\delta$ 18 O and $\delta$ 2 H content of recent groundwaters in the British Isles show a fundamental SW-NE depletion effect modified by topography. The range of measured values, while much smaller than those for rainfall, still covers some 4‰ for $\delta$ 18 O and 30‰ for $\delta$ 2 H. Over lowland areas the 'altitude effect' is of little significance, but in upland areas is consistent with a range of –0.2 to –0.3‰ per 100 m increase in altitude. Groundwaters dating from the late Pleistocene are usually modified in $\delta$ 18 O and $\delta$ 2 H owing to the effects of climate change on the isotopic composition of rainfall and thus of recharge. Contour maps of isotopic variability prior to 10 ka BP, based on the relatively limited information available from the British Isles, allow a first comparison between groundwaters now and at the end of the last Ice Age. The position of the British Isles in the context of the stable isotope systematics of NW Europe is reviewed briefly.},

Overall, 218 GNIR river stations were clustered into 3 different groups based on the seasonal variation in their isotopic composition, which was closely coupled to precipitation and snow-melt water run-off regimes. Sinusoidal fit functions revealed periodic phases within each grouping and deviations from the sinusoidal functions revealed important river alterations or hydrological processes in these watersheds. The seasonal isotopic amplitude of $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O in rivers averaged 2.5 &permil;, and did not increase as a function of latitude, as it does for global precipitation. Low seasonal isotopic amplitudes in rivers suggest the prevalence of mixing and storage such as occurs via lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater. The application of a catchment-constrained regionalized cluster-based water isotope prediction model (CC-RCWIP) allowed direct comparison between the expected isotopic composition for the upstream catchment precipitation with the measured isotopic composition of river discharge at observation stations. The catchment-constrained model revealed a strong global isotopic correlation between average rainfall and river discharge (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.88) and the study demonstrated that the seasonal isotopic composition and variation of river water can be predicted. Deviations in data from model predicted values suggest there are important natural or anthropogenic catchment processes, like evaporation, damming, and water storage in the upstream catchment.</p>},

Modern research assessing the effect of climate and environment on the Middle Palaeolithic and transition to the Upper Palaeolithic has often turned to southern Europe, specifically peninsular southern Europe (Iberia, Italy and the Balkans). These are regions typically regarded as refugia during periods of unfavourable climatic conditions, inspiring hundreds of palaeoenvironmental studies at Neanderthal sites and hypotheses on late Neanderthal survival in locations with relative ameliorated conditions. Here, we present the topic of the special issue focusing on peninsular southern Europe refugia during the Middle Palaeolithic covering the three main peninsulas. Its 16 contributions discuss relevant data on peninsular southern Europe as possible refugia during periods of unfavourable climate during the Middle Palaeolithic and transition to Upper Palaeolithic.},

In this study we present the first open-air Châtelperronian site in the Northern Iberian Peninsula, Aranbaltza II. The technological features of its stone tool assemblage show no links with previous Middle Paleolithic technology in the region, and chronological modeling reveals a gap between the latest Middle Paleolithic and the Châtelperronian in this area. We interpret this as evidence of local Neandertal extinction and replacement by other Neandertal groups coming from southern France, illustrating how local extinction episodes could have played a role in the process of disappearance of Neandertals.},

Results identify a climate-cooling phase at the end of the Mousterian occupations ({\textasciitilde}45 ka), which transformed a mosaic of patchy forest and humid meadows into a more arid open landscape. Another cooling event, matching Heinrich stadial 4 (H4), coincided with the arrival of the Aurignacians ({\textasciitilde}39 ka).

However, the causes of Neanderthal decline understood as a regional and temporal process remain open. Despite the abundance of technological studies, modern-quality chronological dating, and the availability of archaeofaunal and palaeoenvironmental data, there is a lack of consensus about how climatic and environmental conditions could have affected ungulate prey and, therefore, Neanderthal subsistence strategies. In this paper, an analytical summary of the archaeofaunal and taphonomic data available for the Vasco-Cantabrian region, combined with the most recent chronological evidence, present general knowledge about animal biogeography and ecology during the Middle–Upper Palaeolithic transition, and provides an interpretation of the behaviour of both human species in the region. This work reviews the palaeomammal community of animals represented in the record as exploited by human groups in several caves and rock shelters and pointing to continuing lacunae in knowledge. Further research is needed to verify and potentially explain the apparent hominin population gap and the ultimate fate of the Neanderthals.},

  abstract   = {The Upper Palaeolithic in Europe was a time of extensive climatic changes that impacted on the survival and distribution of human populations. During the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM), southern European peninsulas were refugia for flora, fauna, and human groups. One of these refugia, the Cantabrian region (northern Atlantic Spain), was intensively occupied throughout the Upper Palaeolithic. Characterising how climatic events were expressed in local environments is crucial to understand human and animal survival. La Riera Cave (Asturias) has a rich geo-cultural sequence dating between 20.5kyr BP to 6.5kyr BP and represents an ideal location in which to explore this. Stable isotope analysis of red deer and ibex is used alongside other environmental and climatic proxies to reconstruct Late Upper Palaeolithic conditions. Results show that during the LGM, ibex adapted their niche to survive, and became a major prey species for humans. The diverse environmental opportunities offered in the high-relief and coastal environs of La Riera may help to explain the high human population levels in the Cantabrian Region throughout the Late Upper Palaeolithic. Despite fluctuating conditions, herbivores and humans had the flexibility and resilience to adapt, demonstrating the importance of southern European refugia for the survival of different species.},

  abstract   = {The majority of archaeological remains found at El Castillo in northern Iberia were excavated between 1910 and 1914 by Hugo Obermaier. Since the 1980s El Castillo has been studied through a detailed analysis of Obermaier's original excavation notes, the cleaning and study of the extant section, and the excavation of material in the shelter entrance. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from the modern (1980s onwards) excavation suggested that unit 18, corresponding to Aurignacian Delta of the 1910s excavation, was significantly earlier than other Aurignacian assemblages in western Europe. Combined with a reanalysis of the lithic and osseous industry, these dates led to the suggestion that material in unit 18 and Aurignacian Delta was a transitional industry, showing a gradual transformation of the Mousterian into the Upper Palaeolithic. The conclusion has profound implications for understanding the appearance of the Upper Palaeolithic in western Europe. However, the theory has been heavily debated, with criticism focusing on the analysis of the lithic and bone assemblage as well as the chronology. We focus on the latter, and assess whether the original dates were accurate, whether they were well associated with the archaeology, and whether there was vertical and lateral variation in the age of the assemblages within unit 18 and Aurignacian Delta. New radiocarbon dates on humanly modified bone suggest that in the new area of excavation, unit 18 is found to be earlier than 42 cal kBP, with no evidence of material of a younger age. In contrast, in the old excavation area, Aurignacian Delta does include material of a younger age. This suggests that discussion of the Transitional Aurignacian can only include material from unit 18, in the new area of excavation.},

  abstract   = {Since the late 1980s, northern Iberia has yielded some of the earliest radiocarbon dated Aurignacian assemblages in Western Europe, probably produced by anatomically modern humans (AMHs). This is at odds with its location furthest from the likely eastern entry point of AMHs, and has also suggested to some that the Châtelperronian resulted from cultural transfer from AMHs to Neanderthals. However, the accuracy of the early chronology has been extensively disputed, primarily because of the poor association between the dated samples and human activity. Here, we test the chronology of three sites in northern Iberia, L'Arbreda, Labeko Koba and La Viña, by radiocarbon dating ultrafiltered collagen from anthropogenically modified bones. The published dates from Labeko Koba are shown to be significant underestimates due to the insufficient removal of young contaminants. The early (c.44 ka cal BP [thousands of calibrated years before present]) Aurignacian chronology at L'Arbreda cannot be reproduced, but the reason for this is difficult to ascertain. The existing chronology of La Viña is found to be approximately correct. Together, the evidence suggests that major changes in technocomplexes occurred contemporaneously between the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of northern Iberia, with the Aurignacian appearing around 42 ka cal BP, a date broadly consistent with the appearance of this industry elsewhere in Western Europe.},

  abstract   = {Cold-adapted faunal populations shifted southwards during the coldest episodes of the Middle and Late Pleistocene, reaching the Iberian Peninsula. In this context, some of these species, such as Coelodonta antiquitatis and Mammuthus primigenius extended throughout the territory, leaving evidence in, at least, 35 and 29 sites, respectively; however, in most cases, the evidence is scarce. Here we present the fossil assemblage from Mainea cave (Uitzi, Navarre, northern Iberian Peninsula), one of the sites yielding cold-adapted faunal remains closer to the Pyrenees. The cave possibly acted as a natural trap due to its external geomorphology (a sinkhole) and the absence of aerial exposure, anthropogenic marks or evidence compatible with this site being a hyena den. This site has yielded the most evidence of Coelodonta antiquitatis remains (NISP = 190) and one of the most abundant in terms of number of individuals (five, each with different ages at death) for the Iberian Peninsula, five remains attributed to a single Mammuthus primigenius and a single Cervus elaphus remain. The direct dating of a woolly rhinoceros tooth (46 354–44 428 2s cal. a BP) places Mainea within MIS 3, between the H4 and H5 Heinrich Events, during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition, within a context of changes in human behaviour and human species replacement in Europe. We have performed the first collagen isotopic analysis for a woolly rhinoceros from the Iberian Peninsula. The d13C and d15N values of the Coelodonta antiquitatis remains are similar to other European sites, thus suggesting the presence of Mammoth steppe environments at relatively high altitudes, which would compensate for the southern latitude. This would be consistent with the presence of open environments in lower altitudes. This site expands our understanding of the ecology of cold-adapted faunas at their furthest southern range limit during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition.},

  abstract = {Saltmarshes are tremendously important culturally and ecologically because they can provide abundant nutrient-rich fodder for grazing livestock, with relatively little resource investment. They also perform critical ecological services, including detoxifying water and stabilizing coastlines. For these reasons, methods for investigating the nature and extent of past saltmarsh use have significant potential to provide new insights into patterns in coastal adaptations among past agricultural societies as well as paleoenvironmental change. Stable nitrogen isotope (d15N) analyses of animal bone collagen have been used to investigate ancient saltmarsh use based on the idea that plants growing in saline and/or coastal regions can have higher d15N values. However, interpretation of d15N evidence for saltmarsh use can be challenging because variation in terrestrial nitrogen sources and cycling can result in similarly elevated in d15N values in animals that did not feed in saltmarshes. Ecological studies show that stable carbon (d13C) and sulfur (d34S) isotope analyses are well suited for investigating saltmarsh use because key species (particularly those in the genus Spartina) that dominate these ecosystems in many areas of the world are C4 plants capable of incorporating sulfuide-derived, 34S-depleted sulfur. We investigate the utility of d13C, d34S, and d15N for tracking saltmarsh use in archaeological herbivores (n = 80) from seventeenth-to-eighteenth-century Acadian settlements in Canada, which were renowned for their agricultural use of saltmarsh ecosystems. Results show extreme variation in d13C and d34S consistent with feeding along C3-to-C4 and sulfate-to-sulfide-derived sulfur continuums. Significant correlations between d13C and d34S suggests that variation in these isotopic compositions reflects the relative importance of Spartina in past Acadian animal husbandry. These findings indicate that, even in areas where other 13C-eniched food sources are available (e.g., seaweeds, maize), combined d13C and d34S analyses should be able to identify Spartina use in coastal regions. A strong negative correlation was also found between d34S and d15N, suggesting that processes driving coastal sulfur and nitrogen cycles in the region are coupled (independently of Spartina consumption) and provide new insights into the mechanism behind 15N enrichment observed in saltmarsh plants.},

  abstract = {Rationale The species-specific relationship between phosphate (d18OP values) and structural carbonate (d18OC values) oxygen isotope ratios has been established for several modern and fossil animal species but until now it has not been investigated in European fallow deer (Dama dama dama). This study describes the relationship between phosphate and structural carbonate bioapatite in tooth enamel of extant fallow deer, which will help us further understand the species' unique environmental and cultural history. Methods The oxygen isotope composition of phosphate (d18OP value) and structural carbonate (d18OC value) of hydroxylapatite was determined in 51 modern fallow deer tooth enamel samples from across Europe and West Asia. The d18OC values were measured on a GV IsoPrime dual-inlet mass spectrometer and the d18OP values on a temperature-controlled elemental analyser (TC/EA) coupled to a DeltaPlus XL isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a ConFlo III interface. Results This study establishes a direct and linear relationship between the d18OC and d18OP values from fallow deer tooth enamel (d18OC = +9.244(±0.216) + 0.958 * d18OP (±0.013)). Despite the successful regression, the variation in d18O values from samples collected in the same geographical area is greater than expected, although the results cluster in broad climatic groupings when Koppen-Geiger classifications are taken into account for the individuals' locations. Conclusions This is the first comprehensive study of the relationship between ionic forms of oxygen (phosphate oxygen and structural carbonate) in fallow deer dental enamel. The new equation will allow direct comparison with other herbivore data. Variable d18O values within populations of fallow deer broadly reflect the ecological zones they are found in which may explain this pattern of results in other euryphagic species.},

Fossil bones and dentin have better crystallinity than recent specimens, indicating diagenetic change. Fossil enamel, on the other hand, is identical in crystallinity to recent enamel, indicating the lack of diagenetic alteration. Comparison of d18O of carbonate and phosphate of the skeletal elements suggests that the coexisting phosphate and carbonate of both the recent and fossil specimens are close to isotopic equilibrium. This might suggest that both phases were affected by the same degree of diagenetic alteration, and that comparison of their d18O is not useful for the selection of pristine material for paleoclimatic reconstruction purposes.

They exploited a wide range of resources from large proboscideans to small animals like turtles, rabbits, and marine species. Here, we discuss the importance of ibex and chamois in Neanderthal hunting strategies. The exploitation of both animals has traditionally been regarded as typical of Homo sapiens hunting behavior but was not a feature of Neanderthal behavior, which was thought to have focused on other kinds of game like deer, horses or large bovids. Our analysis of an extensive sample of Middle Paleolithic sites with faunal remains in the Iberian Peninsula reveals that Iberian ibex and chamois were frequently present throughout this period. Statistical analyses allowed us to assess the conditions that might have favored the presence or absence of these animals in the sites, while the taphonomic analyses enabled us to address the issue of whether ibex and chamois were indeed hunted by Neanderthals in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results indicate a better representation of both species in rocky and mountainous areas. The taphonomy of some sites reveals that chamois and ibex were hunted by Neanderthals, who showed great adaptive capacities to a wide variety of environments, including mountainous habitats. In contrast, other sites with favorable ecological conditions for ibex and chamois where these animals were not exploited by Neanderthals, who chose to hunt other species like deer, horses or aurochs, suggest behavioral complexity and large versatility.},

The carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 abundances in bone collagen confirmed that the coexistence of the large herbivores was facilitated by a pronounced dietary niche partitioning, with some species relatively flexible in the exploitation of browse and graze, while others were more specialized. The isotopic abundances of carbon and nitrogen in carnivores confirm a dietary partitioning, probably based on the size of prey, with an increasingly generalist behavior emerging after the Last Glacial Maximum with notable exceptions. Isotopic investigation reveals dynamic processes of ecological displacement and replacement, shedding new light on the potential niche spectrum of extant species that are now present as relic populations. ▪ The Mammoth Steppe is an extinct nonanalog ecosystem with high productivity and biodiversity despite the cold and dry conditions of the Last Glacial Period. ▪ Stable isotopes reveal that niche partitioning among herbivores and carnivores is a dominant trait of the Mammoth Steppe. ▪ Switches in preferred prey and ecological replacement are observed among carnivores over time, with the few highly specialized predators going extinct. ▪ Warmer and more humid conditions preceding the Holocene impacted large herbivores in most regions of the Mammoth Steppe, driving some of the largest ones to extinction.},

This solution has been improved with respect to La93 (Laskar et al. [CITE]) by using a direct integration of the gravitational equations for the orbital motion, and by improving the dissipative contributions, in particular in the evolution of the Earth–Moon System. The orbital solution has been used for the calibration of the Neogene period (Lourens et al. [CITE]), and is expected to be used for age calibrations of paleoclimatic data over 40 to 50 Myr, eventually over the full Palaeogene period (65 Myr) with caution. Beyond this time span, the chaotic evolution of the orbits prevents a precise determination of the Earth's motion. However, the most regular components of the orbital solution could still be used over a much longer time span, which is why we provide here the solution over 250 Myr. Over this time interval, the most striking feature of the obliquity solution, apart from a secular global increase due to tidal dissipation, is a strong decrease of about 0.38 degree in the next few millions of years, due to the crossing of the resonance (Laskar et al. [CITE]). For the calibration of the Mesozoic time scale (about 65 to 250 Myr), we propose to use the term of largest amplitude in the eccentricity, related to , with a fixed frequency of /yr, corresponding to a period of 405 000 yr. The uncertainty of this time scale over 100 Myr should be about , and over the full Mesozoic era.},

  abstract   = {The geomorphological evolution of the Cobiheru Cave shows the influence of the non-carbonate coastal mountain ranges on coastal karst evolution, as well as the temporal distribution of the cold-adapted fauna sites in the Cantabrian Coast. Geomorphological observation and uranium/thorium (U/Th) dating lead to the construction of an evolution model. The model comprises two episodes of cave deposition occurring at c. 60–70 and 130–150 ka, linked to cold climate conditions, global sea-level lowstands and the erosion of alluvial fans that covered the karst. Moreover, the comparison between the Cobiheru record and some raised beaches identified in previous studies sets the beginning of the sea-level lowering in the Cantabrian Sea during the marine isotope stages (MIS) 5–4 transition. Two palaeoenvironments are inferred based on finding Equus ferus and Elona quimperiana. A wet deciduous forest would have developed on the emerged marine terrace of the Cobiheru Cave since at least the Middle Pleistocene, and an open landscape with scarce vegetation would have been present at c. 65 ka. The erosional event identified in the Cobiheru Cave helps to understand the temporal distribution of cold-adapted mammals located in the Asturias region. The probable sites of cold-adapted fauna developed in caves and alluvial fans would have disappeared after 65 ka. Therefore, palaeontological and palaeoclimate research based on cold-adapted mammals suggests the occurrence of an hiatus in the palaeontological record prior to 50 ka.

  abstract  = {We propose for the first time the use of the combination of two high-resolution techniques, dental wear (meso- and microwear) and dental cementum analyses, to gain a better understanding of Neanderthal subsistence strategies and occupational patterns. Dental wear analysis provides information not only on ungulate palaeodiet and palaeoenvironments but also on hunting time and seasons. Dental cementum analysis allows the accurate determination of the age and season at death of a prey. Our study has focused on the Cantabrian region and has applied both methods to investigate the Mousterian faunal assemblages in Covalejos Cave. Identification of the ungulate palaeodiet reveals information on the environmental conditions of the studied region. Moreover, it may facilitate observation on the evolution of both palaeodiet and palaeoenvironment throughout the site sequence. Results show a general stability in the palaeoenvironmental conditions and in the ungulate palaeodiet throughout the Mousterian sequence; this finding may be attributed to the role of the area as a climate refuge, and slight differences in levels 8, 7 and 4 suggest long- or short-term but repeated Neanderthal occupations at different seasons in the annual cycle.},

  abstract = {The ecology of Neanderthals is a pressing question in the study of hominin evolution. Diet appears to have played a prominent role in their adaptation to Eurasia. Based on isotope and zooarchaeological studies, Neanderthal diet has been reconstructed as heavily meat-based and generally similar across different environments. This image persists, despite recent studies suggesting more plant use and more variation. However, we have only a fragmentary picture of their dietary ecology, and how it may have varied among habitats, because we lack broad and environmentally representative information about their use of plants and other foods. To address the problem, we examined the plant microremains in Neanderthal dental calculus from five archaeological sites representing a variety of environments from the northern Balkans, and the western, central and eastern Mediterranean. The recovered microremains revealed the consumption of a variety of non-animal foods, including starchy plants. Using a modeling approach, we explored the relationships among microremains and environment, while controlling for chronology. In the process, we compared the effectiveness of various diversity metrics and their shortcomings for studying microbotanical remains, which are often morphologically redundant for identification. We developed Minimum Botanical Units as a new way of estimating how many plant types or parts are present in a microbotanical sample. In contrast to some previous work, we found no evidence that plant use is confined to the southern-most areas of Neanderthal distribution. Although interpreting the ecogeographic variation is limited by the incomplete preservation of dietary microremains, it is clear that plant exploitation was a widespread and deeply rooted Neanderthal subsistence strategy, even if they were predominately game hunters. Given the limited dietary variation across Neanderthal range in time and space in both plant and animal food exploitation, we argue that vegetal consumption was a feature of a generally static dietary niche.},

  abstract   = {The Late Upper Palaeolithic of Europe, particularly the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 26-19 kyr cal BP), was a time of dramatic climatic changes. Fauna, and the humans that preyed on them, were forced to adapt their behaviours in response to climate changes to survive. The Cantabrian Region of northern Spain was continuously inhabited during this period when many other areas of Europe were inhospitable. The site of Las Caldas (Asturias) was repeatedly occupied by hunter-gatherers during the Solutrean (26.1–20.3 kyr cal BP) and Magdalenian (18.5–14.3 kyr cal BP). This paper uses d13C and d15N stable isotope analysis of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) remains to reconstruct past environments, ungulate niches and habitats, and to understand how this impacted on their availability as a prey source. Results show that during the Solutrean, cold and potentially wet LGM conditions were experienced and ibex lived in lower altitudes, likely due to reduced vegetation, and even small glaciers on the higher mountain slopes. Improved environmental conditions in the Magdalenian allowed ibex to live in their preferred habitat of higher altitudes. Ameliorated Late Glacial conditions correspond with changing economic hunting strategies at the site. Humans exploited wider ecological zones, over larger distances, which coincides with population growth, and greater connectivity across the Cantabrian region. This research highlights the importance of characterising the complex interactions between humans, animals and environments during the Late Pleistocene and how they responded to rapidly changing environmental conditions.},
